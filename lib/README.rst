*************************
Knot DNS Resolver library
*************************

Requirements
============

* libknot_ 2.0 (Knot DNS high-performance DNS library.)

For users
=========

The library as described provides basic services for name resolution, which should cover the usage,
examples are in the :ref:`resolve API <lib_api_rplan>` documentation.

.. tip:: If you're migrating from ``getaddrinfo()``, see *"synchronous"* API, but the library offers iterative API as well to plug it into your event loop for example.

.. _lib-layers:

For developers
==============

The resolution process starts with the functions in :ref:`resolve.c <lib_api_rplan>`, they are responsible for:

* reacting to state machine state (i.e. calling consume layers if we have an answer ready)
* interacting with the user (i.e. asking caller for I/O, accepting queries)
* fetching assets needed by layers (i.e. zone cut, next best NS address or trust anchor)

These we call as *driver*. The driver is not meant to know *"how"* the query is resolved, but rather *"when"* to execute *"what"*. Typically here you can modify or reorder the resolution plan, or request input from the caller.

   :align: center

On the other side are *layers*. They are responsible for dissecting the packets and informing the driver about the results. For example, a produce layer can generate a sub-request, a consume layer can satisfy an outstanding query or simply log something, but they should **never** alter resolution plan directly, as it would change "current query" for next-in-line layers (appending to the resolution plan is fine). They also must not block, and may not be paused.

.. tip:: Layers are executed asynchronously by the driver. If you need some asset beforehand, you can signalize the driver using returning state or current query flags. For example, setting a flag ``QUERY_AWAIT_CUT`` forces driver to fetch zone cut information before the packet is consumed; setting a ``QUERY_RESOLVED`` flag makes it pop a query after the current set of layers is finished; returning ``FAIL`` state makes it fail current query. The important thing is, these actions happen **after** current set of layers is done.

Writing layers
==============

The resolver :ref:`library <lib_index>` leverages the `processing API`_ from the libknot to separate packet processing code into layers.

.. note:: This is only crash-course in the library internals, see the resolver :ref:`library <lib_index>` documentation for the complete overview of the services.

The library offers following services:

- :ref:`Cache <lib_api_cache>` - MVCC cache interface for retrieving/storing resource records.
- :ref:`Resolution plan <lib_api_rplan>` - Query resolution plan, a list of partial queries (with hierarchy) sent in order to satisfy original query. This contains information about the queries, nameserver choice, timing information, answer and its class.
- :ref:`Nameservers <lib_api_nameservers>` - Reputation database of nameservers, this serves as an aid for nameserver choice.

A processing layer is going to be called by the query resolution driver for each query,
so you're going to work with :ref:`struct kr_request <lib_api_rplan>` as your per-query context.
This structure contains pointers to resolution context, resolution plan and also the final answer.

.. code-block:: c

	int consume(knot_layer_t *ctx, knot_pkt_t *pkt)
	{
		struct kr_request *request = ctx->data;
		struct kr_query *query = kr_rplan_current(request->rplan);
	}

This is only passive processing of the incoming answer. If you want to change the course of resolution, say satisfy a query from a local cache before the library issues a query to the nameserver, you can use states (see the :ref:`Static hints <mod-hints>` for example).

.. warning:: Never replace or push new queries onto the resolution plan, this is a job of the resolution driver. Single pass through layers expects *current query* to be constant. You can however signalize driver with requests using query flags, like ``QUERY_RESOLVED`` to mark it as resolved.

.. code-block:: c

	int produce(knot_layer_t *ctx, knot_pkt_t *pkt)
	{
		struct kr_request *request = ctx->data;
		struct kr_query *cur = kr_rplan_current(request->rplan);
		
		/* Query can be satisfied locally. */
		if (can_satisfy(cur)) {
			/* This flag makes the resolver move the query
			 * to the "resolved" list. */
			query->flags |= QUERY_RESOLVED;
			return KNOT_STATE_DONE;
		}

		/* Pass-through. */
		return ctx->state;
	}

It is possible to not only act during the query resolution, but also to view the complete resolution plan afterwards. This is useful for analysis-type tasks, or *"per answer"* hooks.

.. code-block:: c

	int finish(knot_layer_t *ctx)
	{
		struct kr_request *request = ctx->data;
		struct kr_rplan *rplan = request->rplan;

		/* Print the query sequence with start time. */
		char qname_str[KNOT_DNAME_MAXLEN];
		struct kr_query *qry = NULL
		WALK_LIST(qry, rplan->resolved) {
			knot_dname_to_str(qname_str, qry->sname, sizeof(qname_str));
			printf("%s at %u\n", qname_str, qry->timestamp);
		}

		return ctx->state;
	}
